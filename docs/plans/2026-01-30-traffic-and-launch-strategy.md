## Philosophy: Passive Discoverability

This is a side project. Skip active outreach (newsletter pitching, podcast appearances, influencer relationships). Instead, focus on making the tool **discoverable** and letting it spread on its own merit.

### Where Traffic Comes From

| Source | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| GitHub Marketplace | Organic | People searching for Actions find you |
| Product Hunt | One-time spike | Single launch, then long tail from backlinks |
| Social posts | Optional | Share when you feel like it |
| SEO | Passive | Landing page + comparison content |
| Word of mouth | Organic | Users who like it tell others |

### What We Skip

- Newsletter pitching (time-intensive, low ROI)
- Podcast outreach (requires relationship building)
- Influencer outreach (unpredictable, high effort)
- Guest posting (too much work for a GitHub Action)

If inbound opportunities come, great. But we don't chase them.

## Goals

| Metric | 30 Days | 90 Days | 6 Months |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| GitHub Stars | 50 | 300 | 1,000 |
| Installs (Actions runs) | 20 | 100 | 500 |
| Website Visitors | 500 | 2,000 | 10,000 |

Realistic targets for a side project without active outreach. Growth comes from GitHub Marketplace, Product Hunt spike, social posts, and organic SEO.

## Channel Strategy (ORB Framework)

### Owned Channels (Build These First)

You control these. They compound over time.

| Channel | Purpose | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Landing Page | Convert traffic, explain value | High |
| GitHub README | First impression for most visitors | High |
| Blog (optional) | SEO, thought leadership, repurposable content | Low |

**GitHub README Optimization:**
- Clear value prop in first 2 lines
- Animated GIF showing PR check in action
- Badges: GitHub stars, license, Marketplace
- Quick install snippet (copy-paste ready)
- FAQ section addressing common objections

### Rented Channels (Where Your Audience Lives)

You don't control these, but your audience is here. Use them to drive traffic to owned channels.

| Platform | Why | Content Type |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| Twitter/X | Developer community, real-time engagement | Threads, hot takes, build-in-public |
| LinkedIn | B2B decision makers, content marketers who work with devs | Educational posts, behind-scenes |
| Reddit | r/webdev, r/programming, r/SaaS, r/indiehackers | Valuable comments, occasional launches |
| Hacker News | Tech-savvy early adopters | Launch posts, Show HN |

**Content Pillars for Social:**

| Pillar | % | Examples |
|--------|---|----------|
| Build in Public | 40% | Progress updates, decisions made, lessons learned |
| Educational | 30% | Brand voice tips, content consistency, CI/CD for content |
| Product Updates | 20% | New features, improvements, roadmap |
| Personal/Story | 10% | Why you built this, challenges, wins |

**Weekly Social Cadence (1-2 hours/week):**
- 2-3 Twitter posts (mix of pillars)
- 1 LinkedIn post (longer-form, educational)
- Engage in comments on relevant posts (15 min/day)

### Borrowed Channels (Passive Only)

For a side project, skip active outreach. Focus on discoverability — let people find you.

| Channel | Effort | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| GitHub Marketplace | One-time | List as a GitHub Action — organic discovery |
| Dev directories | One-time | BetaList, DevHunt, SaaSHub, AlternativeTo |
| Product Hunt | One-time | Single launch day, then done |
| Awesome lists | One-time | Submit to relevant "awesome-*" repos |
| Dev.to cross-post | Low | Post your blog content there (built-in audience) |

**Skip entirely:**
- Newsletter pitching (time-intensive, low ROI for this scope)
- Podcast outreach (requires relationship building)
- Influencer outreach (unpredictable, high effort)
- Guest posting (too much work for a GitHub Action)

If someone reaches out to you, great. But don't chase it.

## Phased Launch Plan

### Phase 1: Stealth / Internal (Before Landing Page)

**Goal:** Get first 10-20 users, iron out bugs, collect testimonials.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Share with friends who have side projects
- [ ] Post in small Discord/Slack communities you're already in
- [ ] Reach out to 5-10 developers directly (DMs, not cold email)
- [ ] Collect feedback and fix critical issues
- [ ] Ask for 2-3 short testimonials

**Talking Points:**
- "Hey, I built this thing to solve [problem]. Would you try it and tell me what sucks?"
- No hard sell — genuine feedback request

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Landing Page Live)

**Goal:** Build initial traction, get first stars and installs.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Publish landing page
- [ ] Optimize GitHub README with badges and GIF
- [ ] Announce on personal Twitter/LinkedIn
- [ ] Post in r/SideProject, r/webdev (genuine, not spammy)
- [ ] Submit to smaller directories (BetaList, SaaSHub, DevHunt)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### Phase 3: Product Hunt Launch

**Goal:** Visibility spike, social proof, backlinks.

**Preparation (2 weeks before):**

**Launch Day:**

**Post-Launch:**

### Phase 4: Sustained Growth

**Goal:** Compound gains, build flywheel.

**Weekly Activities:**
- [ ] 2-3 social posts per week
- [ ] Engage in 5-10 relevant conversations
- [ ] Publish one piece of content (blog post, thread, video)
- [ ] Monitor GitHub issues and respond quickly

**Monthly Activities:**
- [ ] Review analytics, double down on what's working
- [ ] Ship one notable improvement (content for social announcement)
- [ ] Submit to one new directory or awesome list (if any left)

## Content Ideas

### High-Value Topics (SEO + Social)

| Topic | Angle | Format |
|-------|-------|--------|
| "Why your app's copy is inconsistent" | Problem awareness | Blog + Thread |
| "Content linting for developers" | Educational | Blog + LinkedIn |
| "I automated brand voice reviews" | Build in public | Thread |
| "Brand voice guide template" | Lead magnet | Downloadable + Email gate |
| "CI/CD for content: the missing piece" | Thought leadership | Blog + HN |
| "How [Company] maintains voice at scale" | Case study | Blog + Social |

### Comparison Content (Bottom-of-Funnel)

Create pages targeting people searching for solutions:

- "Stringly-Typed vs manual content review"
- "Stringly-Typed vs prose linters (write-good, alex)"
- "AI content checking tools for developers"

These pages capture high-intent search traffic.

### Repurposing Flow

```
Blog Post
    ├── Twitter thread (key points)
    ├── LinkedIn post (business angle)
    ├── Reddit comment (when relevant)
    ├── Newsletter section
    └── GitHub README update (if applicable)
```

One piece of content → 5+ distribution points.
